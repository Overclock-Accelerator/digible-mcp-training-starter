"""
GetAnswers Tool

Purpose:
- Answer questions about the bookstore’s current books (availability, prices, sales, etc.)

Note:
- Now implemented for title-based questions against `storedata.json`.

LangChain note (why `@tool`?)
-----------------------------
The `@tool` decorator turns a normal Python function into a LangChain "Tool" object.
That object can be:
- called directly by Python (via `.invoke({...})`)
- or (later) exposed to an agent/LLM that decides when to call it.

This project currently calls tools directly (no LLM agent loop yet).
